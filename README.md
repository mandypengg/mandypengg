Hi everyone! I'm Mandy, a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo currently in my 1B term. 

I’m currently working on MyoMap, a web application that contains all the information a beginner would need when starting out in the gym. Designed to be easy to navigate and help others streamline thier fitness journey.

I love learning, so if you have any tips & tricks for me, feel free to reach out! I'm currently learning JavaScript, and strengthing my knowledge in HTML/CSS.

Some fun facts about me is that I love sports and have always been physically active throughout my childhood. I've been going to the gym consistently 6x a week for over 3 years now. Along side weightlifting, I have been on my schools Varsity Ultimate Team for 4 years. I am currently on the University of Waterloo Varsity Womens team! Prior to Ultimate Frisbee, I was on the Track & Field team for 7 years.
